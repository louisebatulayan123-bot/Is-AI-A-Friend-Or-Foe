        <h2>What is AI?</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is where computer systems are able to perform more difficult tasks which are normally done by a human, like recognising faces or understanding speech. <p></p>
It learns by looking at lots of examples, spotting patterns, and then using those patterns to make guesses or decisions, a bit like how you get better at a game the more you play.</p>

        <h2>Where is AI used?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>On your phone:</strong> AI unlocks your phone with face or fingerprint recognition and suggests apps, videos or songs you might like.</li>
                    <li><strong>Online:</strong> Search engines and recommendation systems use AI to show results, videos and games that match what you are interested in.</li>
                    <li><strong>In the real world:</strong> AI can help drivers with maps, doctors when they look at scans, and can power robots in warehouses and factories.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>So, is AI our friend?</h2>
                <p>AI can be a really helpful, but only when people use it carefully. It can save time, make learning easier, and help solve problems that are too big or too fast for humans to fix alone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Why it can be helpful:</strong> AI can support schoolwork, improve health care, and make everyday tasks like travelling or translating languages simpler.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why we must be careful:</strong> AI does not truly understand feelings or fairness, so it can get things wrong, misunderstand context, or copy unfair patterns from its training data. Over‑relying on AI can also mean humans stop checking if they share accurate information or practising their own skills.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>AI is <strong>NOT</strong> a friend or foe on it's own, it depends on how people design it, use it, and choose when to trust it.</p>
